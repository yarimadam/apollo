# Apollo

> A self-hosted streaming stack for Stremio/Nuvio: addons, metadata, and the
> infrastructure to run them, all behind a single reverse proxy.

Apollo bundles a [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/)/[Nuvio](https://github.com/NuvioMedia)
streaming addon ([AIOStreams](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams)) and a
metadata addon ([AIOMetadata](https://github.com/cedya77/aiometadata)) and an
account/addon manager ([AIOManager](https://github.com/Sonicx161/AIOManager)) behind
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), with [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
for container management, [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching, and
automated [restic](https://restic.net/) backups, orchestrated end-to-end with
[Task](https://taskfile.dev).

This is an opinionated setup, not a general-purpose template: **Tailscale is
mandatory**, not an optional extra. Portainer has no public exposure path; it
serves its own HTTPS (self-signed cert) on port 9443, bound only to the host's
Tailscale IP. There's no fallback for running this without a tailnet.

## Features

- AIOStreams: unified streaming addon for Stremio/Nuvio clients
- AIOMetadata: metadata addon, with its built-in image cache on a separate
  volume that backups skip, since the images can be re-downloaded
- AIOManager: addon management and sync across Stremio/Nuvio accounts,
  with registrations closed once your own account exists
- Caddy in front of the public sites, with real Let's Encrypt certs
- Portainer for container management, reachable only over the tailnet at
  `https://<tailscale-ip>:9443`
- Automated restic backup/prune/check jobs, covering every service's `.env`
  alongside its data volume; local by default, optionally offsite (e.g.
  Cloudflare R2)
- One `compose.yaml` per service, sharing an external Docker network
- Pinned image versions everywhere, no floating `latest` tags
- Hardened containers: all capabilities dropped (only what each image needs
  is added back), `no-new-privileges`, PID limits, read-only root filesystem
  for Caddy and Redis
- `task up` / `task down` for the whole stack or a single service

```

Every service lives in its own folder with its own `compose.yaml` and
`.env`, all attached to one external `apollo` Docker network. There's no
monolithic compose file; spin services up and down independently, or all
together.

Caddy additionally joins `apollo_edge`, an IPv6-enabled network that carries
its published ports. Docker then forwards IPv6 clients by kernel NAT instead
of through `docker-proxy`, so Caddy (and the addons behind it) see real client
addresses on IPv6 too. The addons stay IPv4-only, which keeps their outbound
traffic to debrid/usenet services on a single address.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), installed and running on the host:
  required, not optional. Portainer is only reachable over it.

### Installation

```sh
git clone <this-repo>
cd apollo
for d in */; do [ -f "$d.env.example" ] && cp "$d.env.example" "$d.env"; done
# fill in each */.env with your domains, IPs, and secrets
task up
```

Task creates the shared networks and brings every service up in the
right order.

### Usage

```sh
task up                  # start everything
task down                # stop everything
task up:aiostreams        # start a single service
task down:caddy           # stop a single service
task --list                # see all available tasks
```

## Configuration

Each service reads only its own `<service>/.env` (see the `.env.example`
next to it for the full, documented template), so every `compose.yaml` runs
on its own. Key things you'll want to set:

- `portainer/.env` `INTERFACE`: the host's Tailscale IP
  (`tailscale ip -4`); Portainer binds here only
- `caddy/.env` `AIOSTREAMS_DOMAIN` / `AIOMETADATA_DOMAIN` /
  `AIOMANAGER_DOMAIN`: public hostnames for each service
- `caddy/.env` `TLS`: `tls internal` for local dev, empty in production
  (real Let's Encrypt certs, issued automatically)
- `backup/.env` `RESTIC_PASSWORD`: encrypts your backup repository
- `backup/.env` `RESTIC_REPOSITORY`: optional restic backend URL for offsite
  backups (e.g. Cloudflare R2); leave empty for local-only

A few values describe a connection between two services, so they must be
set to the same value in both files:

- Redis password: `redis/.env` `PASSWORD`, and `REDIS_PASSWORD` in
  `aiostreams/.env` and `aiometadata/.env`
- Public URLs: `caddy/.env` domains and each app's own base URL

`.env` files are git-ignored, never commit them. The `.env.example` files
are the tracked, secret-free templates.

See [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md) for restoring the stack onto a fresh server
from backup.
